A font size is either fixed or fluid.
If it is fixed, as the screen size increases in pixels, the width in font size units increases proportionally.
If it is fluid, the font size will be a percentage of the screen space, and the width in font size units will be fixed.

Which one to go for?

Basically, it depends on your layout and the purpose of your applications.

If the application is text heavy or contains any text at all (?), you need to ensure that the line length of text elements will be comfortably readable.
At the same time, a comfortable font size for reading will not necessarily be useful as a tool, because screen space is sparse and by blowing up the size
of UI elements, you just won't have enough space to display content.
Finally a user should have control.
